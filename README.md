### **Task Summary: Simple Weather Application**  

#### **Development Environment:**  
For this task, I used **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my development environment to write, compile, and execute the Java program. VS Code provides a clean interface and useful extensions, such as the **Java Extension Pack**, which helps with writing and debugging Java code.  

#### **Overview of the Program:**  
The program is a **simple weather application** that fetches and displays real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It performs the following operations:  

- Sends an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API  
- Parses the JSON response received from the API  
- Extracts and displays key weather details, including:  
  - City name  
  - Temperature (in Celsius)  
  - Humidity percentage  
  - Weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, rainy, etc.)  
- Handles errors and displays appropriate messages if the API request fails  

#### **Applicability of the Code:**  
This program can be useful in various real-world applications, such as:  

- **Weather Dashboard:** Displaying real-time weather updates for a specific city  
- **Mobile and Web Apps:** Integrating weather data into applications  
- **Smart Home Systems:** Fetching weather details for automation purposes  
- **Travel Applications:** Providing weather forecasts for trip planning  

#### **What I Learned:**  
Through this task, I gained practical experience in:  

- **Making HTTP requests** in Java using `HttpURLConnection`  
- **Parsing JSON responses** using the `org.json` library  
- **Handling API errors and exceptions** to ensure program stability  
- Understanding how **REST APIs** work and how to fetch **real-time data** in Java  

This task helped me understand how to integrate external APIs into Java applications and work with **JSON data parsing** effectively.
